Airlines business analysis
## Business Problem
* Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small businss jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environment regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.
## Objectives
* Increase occupancy rate
* Enhance customer experience
* Improve pricing strategy
The end goal of this project would be identifying opportunity to increase the occupancy rate on low-perfoming flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airlines.
